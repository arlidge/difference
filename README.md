# difference
Compare two text files to see what changes have been made.

I wanted a way to compare my Instagram followers on a day by day basis, tracking accounts that have unfollowed me.

I use https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot to get my followers lists.

I can then compare the two to see who has unfollowed me.

This script saves an html file and has handy colour coded visuals.

credit goes to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1x6h19M9j0 - I just put it on Github as I saw he had not.

Instructions:

Change text1 and text2 to your two lists accordingly.

then run - python3 different.py

It should create a file called "difference_report"

Open in your default browser to view.
